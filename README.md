# Sagesse Machine
* This is a course project which use a online chatroom to control webduino.

## Design Concept
* While we heard about AI (Artificial Intellegence) and smart home, that give us a inspiration about why not combine both of it with IoT network.
* We discuss and try a lot of social software, and abandon Line and Message eventually for the following reasons:
	* We can't control the API
	* The problem of authentication
	* We can't get the data from back-end database

## Basic Structure
* In this project, we have 3 parts of it:
	1. sagesse machine
	2. puissant plantation (Collaborate with [@bessyhuang](https://github.com/bessyhuang))
	3. fantaisie lumiere
